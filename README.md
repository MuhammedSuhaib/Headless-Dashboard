This project aimed to create a free, forever headless CMS solution using Firebase for data management and ImageKit for image storage and transformation. Development has been discontinued because I lost the logic. Thanks to AI, and since I have no time to calmly revisit it, the project is open for anyone to fork, edit, and enhance as desired.
